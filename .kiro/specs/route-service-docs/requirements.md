# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating comprehensive, beautiful documentation for the route_service feature within the Butterfly framework using the Invertase.io documentation framework. The goal is to transform the existing route_service documentation into a polished, user-friendly guide that showcases the feature's capabilities while maintaining consistency with the Butterfly documentation style and philosophy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer using Butterfly, I want comprehensive route service documentation so that I can quickly understand and implement authentication-aware routing in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer visits the route service documentation THEN they SHALL see a clear overview of what the route service does and its key benefits
2. WHEN a developer reads the getting started section THEN they SHALL find step-by-step instructions for basic implementation
3. WHEN a developer needs to understand authentication flow THEN they SHALL find detailed explanations with visual diagrams
4. IF a developer wants to see code examples THEN the documentation SHALL provide complete, runnable code snippets
5. WHEN a developer encounters issues THEN they SHALL find a comprehensive troubleshooting section

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating Butterfly, I want to see the route service's removability and flexibility so that I can adopt it with confidence knowing I'm not locked in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads about route service THEN they SHALL see clear explanations of how to remove or replace the feature
2. WHEN comparing implementation approaches THEN they SHALL see side-by-side examples of Butterfly vs native Flutter approaches
3. IF a developer wants to customize behavior THEN they SHALL find extension points and customization examples
4. WHEN a developer needs to migrate away THEN they SHALL find step-by-step migration guides

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a documentation reader, I want visually appealing and well-structured content with Butterfly-style diagrams so that I can easily navigate and understand the route service features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the documentation THEN it SHALL use consistent formatting with proper headings, code blocks, and visual elements
2. WHEN reading code examples THEN they SHALL be syntax-highlighted and properly formatted
3. WHEN navigating sections THEN they SHALL be logically organized with clear hierarchy
4. WHEN viewing routing flow THEN there SHALL be a Butterfly-style sequence diagram titled "How the Butterfly Route Service Works"
5. WHEN understanding the routing flow THEN the diagram SHALL show the declarative route setup, authentication checks, and redirect logic
6. WHEN viewing on different devices THEN the documentation SHALL be responsive and readable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer implementing advanced routing patterns, I want detailed API documentation and advanced usage examples so that I can leverage the full power of the route service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs API reference THEN they SHALL find complete method signatures and parameter descriptions
2. WHEN implementing complex routing scenarios THEN they SHALL find advanced usage examples
3. WHEN integrating with other Butterfly services THEN they SHALL find integration guides
4. IF performance considerations exist THEN they SHALL be documented with best practices
5. WHEN debugging routing issues THEN they SHALL find debugging tools and techniques

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer implementing Butterfly routing, I want detailed documentation of the complete routing flow including authentication, redirects, and debug features so that I can understand and customize the behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up basic routing THEN the documentation SHALL explain the declarative route setup with initialRoute and generated routes
2. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the documentation SHALL explain extending BaseAuthRoute instead of BaseRouteService
3. WHEN configuring protected routes THEN the documentation SHALL explain that all routes are protected by default except signInRoutePath and signUpRoutePath
4. WHEN setting up public routes THEN the documentation SHALL explain the publicRoutes getter configuration
5. WHEN configuring auth triggers THEN the documentation SHALL explain authTriggerRoutes (defaults to signInRoutePath) and how to add more
6. WHEN handling post-authentication navigation THEN the documentation SHALL explain defaultAuthRoute behavior
7. WHEN implementing deep linking THEN the documentation SHALL explain redirectOverride usage and temporary route storage
8. WHEN debugging routing THEN the documentation SHALL explain debugRoutes that bypass all authentication logic
9. WHEN understanding the complete flow THEN the documentation SHALL include a sequence diagram showing the decision tree from route request to final navigation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a contributor to Butterfly documentation, I want the route service docs to follow established patterns so that the documentation ecosystem remains consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new documentation THEN it SHALL follow the existing Butterfly documentation style guide
2. WHEN adding code examples THEN they SHALL use consistent naming conventions and patterns
3. WHEN structuring content THEN it SHALL match the established documentation hierarchy
4. IF new sections are added THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing navigation
5. WHEN updating content THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing links and references
