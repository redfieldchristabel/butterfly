## Features Overview

Butterfly comes packed with a set of tools to help you write clean, structured, and beautiful
Flutter code ‚Äî without the heavy cost of boilerplate.

At its core, Butterfly gives you **two powerful tools** for writing beautiful, boilerplate-free code


#### üõ†Ô∏è 1. CLI-Based (Generator)

The CLI tool helps you scaffold essential parts of your app effortlessly. One of the key features is
the **model generator**, which saves you from writing repetitive JSON serialization code. It uses
the popular [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) package under the hood, so your models are fully compatible with the
wider Dart ecosystem ‚Äî but without the hassle of manual annotations.

You just define your fields, and Butterfly takes care of the rest.



#### üì¶ 2. Library-Based (Helpers)

In addition to the CLI, Butterfly also includes a range of **helper libraries** designed to simplify
common Flutter patterns. For example, features like `enqueue()` abstract away repetitive Flutter
scheduling tasks like `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback()`, making your code cleaner and
easier to reason about.

Modules like `CoreService`, `AuthService`, and `ThemeService` are all designed with this idea:
**cut boilerplate, keep clarity**.


Whether you're bootstrapping models or just looking for utility helpers that play well with your
existing codebase, Butterfly's got your back.

## üõ†Ô∏è CLI Features

Butterfly's CLI tool offers powerful generators to streamline your Flutter development process.
These tools can be used independently of the Butterfly core library, providing flexibility for
various project setups.

### üìÑ Model Generation

Generate Dart models effortlessly using the
[json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) package, a widely adopted library
maintained by Google. This approach minimizes boilerplate code and ensures compatibility with the
broader Dart ecosystem.

<Info>We understand this approach may feel like vendor lock-in since we depend on specific libraries
like `json_serializable` and `built_value`. However, both are developed and maintained by Google,
and we trust their long-term stability. While there's little alternative to `json_serializable`, for
immutables, `freezed` is a solid option ‚Äî though simpler than `built_value`. For now, we believe
`built_value` covers more edge cases and flexibility, and you can always implement `freezed`
manually if preferred as it simple enough.</Info>

**Basic Command:**
```sh
butterfly generate model <ModelName>
```
**Alias:**
- generate -> gen -> g
- model -> m

**Example:**
```sh
butterfly g m Booking
butterfly gen model UserProfile
```
**Options:**
- `-p`:  Specify a subdirectory within the models folder. Example: `-p booking` places the model in
models/booking/.
- `-i`: Generate an immutable model using the [built_value](https://pub.dev/packages/built_value)
package.

<Info>Note: All generated folders follow `snake_case` naming conventions, and class names follow
`CamelCase`, adhering to Dart best practices.</Info>

### üî¢ Version File Generation

Generate a `version.dart` file at the root of your project, containing constants derived from your
`pubspec.yaml`, such as the app version. This is useful for displaying version information within
your application.

**Command:**
```sh
butterfly generate version
```
<Info>Note: For more comprehensive app metadata, consider using the
[package_info_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/network_info_plus) package.</Info>

### üìù Conventional Commit Messages

Butterfly simplifies your commit process by providing a command that helps you craft messages
adhering to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This
promotes a consistent and meaningful commit history, facilitating better collaboration and
automation.

**Command:**
```sh
butterfly commit
```
**Alias:**
- commit -> c

When you run this command, Butterfly will prompt you to enter details for your commit message,
ensuring it follows the Conventional Commits format.

## üìö Library Features

Butterfly isn't just about CLI tools‚Äîit also offers a suite of library packages designed to streamline your Flutter development. Each library focuses on reducing boilerplate and enhancing code clarity.
