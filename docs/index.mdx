### What is Butterfly?

**Butterfly** is a tool that helps you structure your code to be as beautiful and elegant as its
name suggests.
It’s not a framework — just a lightweight collection of packages designed to reduce boilerplate and
make your Flutter development smoother.

Rest assured, Butterfly is completely optional and non-intrusive. We've built it with
[removability](#removable-library) in mind from day one. Most of our helper documentation includes a
detailed explanation of what happens behind the scenes, along with side-by-side tabs showing how to
achieve the same result using native Flutter code — without Butterfly.

So, if you ever decide to remove it from your project, you'll know exactly how to do it. But of course, we hope this project continues to grow with your support — let’s not say goodbye too soon.


### Initialization

For us taste a little bit of Butterfly feature, we need to initialize it in our project first. So here 
the first backstage we talking about earlier, the command
```bash
butterfly init
```
literally this command just add some folder [models, screens, widgets, services] to your flutter root project.
then we also will ask if your project need to use authentication, mean like did your project need
a user or not. then if yes we will create the model, we also ask for the model name. Then we also ask 
this project need to use router mechanism or not. most of big project use this, for the Beautiful codebase,
this feature is must have. It will make you easier in the feature, trust us on this. Btw, we also add a route.dart
file if you use router feature. Then we also add some services for you to take a look and start with.
if you chose yes for router and auth, ypu will get "AuthService" and "AuthRouteService" services. Then last but
not lease, we have "CoreService" that normally the core of all. it will be use to bind all services from Butterfly
so you just need to initialize one service and the core will take care for others. And Again, all of this service
can be use without Butterfly at all and a little bit copy paste just all you need to option out from this tool.


### Why Butterfly?

Butterfly are created to solve the problem on our internal projects. We notice that each project got some kind of
boilerplate code that we need to write over and over again. So we create this tool to help us with that. In the first
version of it, we just create a simple script to help with it, but we notice that having to change a code or update become
a boilerplate action again, so using the package/library are the way to go since only update once. Then we expand our library
to handle the authorization logic as well. In the old day, the authorization logic resist in the same library as the core logic.
But as we grow we notice that not all flutter application need authorization logic, so we separate it out.

So by then we create a new kinda ecosystem that will help ask start the application faster and more beautiful. But the earlier
version of it kinda lock the developer from choosing the tech (library) that they want and forcing them to use the library
that Butterfly do. This mean like using local database as the Butterfly are built with.

<Info>In old day, We have other name for this tool, only the cli tool are called Butterfly CLI.
But now we create the hold ecosystem to be named as Butterfly</Info>

### Removable Library?

Butterfly is **not** a framework — it's a lightweight tool designed with removability in mind.
We understand that developers are often cautious about adopting new tools, especially those that
might be discontinued in the future. That’s why we built Butterfly to be easy to remove from your
codebase at any time, without hassle.

Our documentation clearly shows how to implement each feature using **Flutter's native approach**,
without relying on Butterfly. Most of our helper guides come with two tabs: one showing how to do it
with Butterfly, and the other showing how to do it manually. This ensures you're never locked in —
you can adopt Butterfly with confidence and remove it whenever you need.
