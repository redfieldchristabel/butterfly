Butterfly is a tool that will help you stucture your code to be more beautiful as the Butterfly.

Rest asure, this is not a framework, just a little bit of pakcages that been use to help you with some of 
your boilerplate. Dont worry we design this tool to be remove from your code base easily also. most of our helper
document give you what actually happen in the backstage, so you can alway remove Butterfly from your code base if we
dont have might to support this project soon. But lets make this project dont meet that soon to fast.


## Walkthrough

### Installation

For us taste a little bit of Butterfly feature, we need to initialize it in our project first. So here 
the first backstage we talking about earlier, the command
```bash
butterlfy init
```
litteraly just add some folder [models, screens, widgets, services] to your flutter root project.
then we also will ask if your project need to use authentication, mean like did your project need
a user or not. then if yes we will create the model, we also ask for the model name. Then we also ask 
this project need to use router mechanism or not. most of big project use this, for the Beautiful codebase,
this feature is must have. It will make you easier in the feature, trust us on this. Btw, we also add a route.dart
file if you use router feature. Then we also add some sesrvices for you to take a look and srart with.
if you chose yes for router and auth, ypu will get "AuthService" and "AuthRouteService" services. Then last but
not lease, we have "CoreService" that normaly the core of all. it will be use to bind all services from Butterfly 
so you just need to initiliaze one service and the core will take care for others. And Again, all of this service
can be use without Butterfly at all and a little bit copy paste just all you need to option out from this tool.

To learn more about the advanced configuration options, check out the [docs](https://use.docs.page/configuration).

### Content

docs.page uses the `docs` directory to store your documentation pages. Two pages have been created for you:

- `index.mdx` - The home page of your documentation site, resolves to the root URL.
- `next-steps.mdx` - A page to help you get started with docs.page, resolves to `/next-steps`.

Documentation can be written using the standard [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and also supports the use of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), 
with the ability to render custom [components](https://use.docs.page/components) for more advanced use cases.

## Preview

To preview your documentation site, head over to [https://docs.page/preview](https://docs.page/preview) in your browser and open this directory.

Previewing your documentation site will allow you to see the changes you make in real-time before you publish to the world.
