### What is Butterfly?

**Butterfly** is a tool that helps you structure your code to be as beautiful and elegant as its
name suggests.
It’s not a framework — just a lightweight collection of packages designed to reduce boilerplate and
make your Flutter development smoother.

Rest assured, Butterfly is completely optional and non-intrusive. We've built it with
[removability](#removable-library) in mind from day one. Most of our helper documentation includes a
detailed explanation of what happens behind the scenes, along with side-by-side tabs showing how to
achieve the same result using native Flutter code — without Butterfly.

So, if you ever decide to remove it from your project, you'll know exactly how to do it. But of course, we hope this project continues to grow with your support — let’s not say goodbye too soon.


### Initialization

For us taste a little bit of Butterfly feature, we need to initialize it in our project first. So here 
the first backstage we talking about earlier, the command
```bash
butterfly init
```
literally this command just add some folder [models, screens, widgets, services] to your flutter root project.
then we also will ask if your project need to use authentication, mean like did your project need
a user or not. then if yes we will create the model, we also ask for the model name. Then we also ask 
this project need to use router mechanism or not. most of big project use this, for the Beautiful codebase,
this feature is must have. It will make you easier in the feature, trust us on this. Btw, we also add a route.dart
file if you use router feature. Then we also add some services for you to take a look and start with.
if you chose yes for router and auth, ypu will get "AuthService" and "AuthRouteService" services. Then last but
not lease, we have "CoreService" that normally the core of all. it will be use to bind all services from Butterfly
so you just need to initialize one service and the core will take care for others. And Again, all of this service
can be use without Butterfly at all and a little bit copy paste just all you need to option out from this tool.


### Why Butterfly?

Butterfly was created to solve real problems we faced in our internal projects. We noticed that each
new Flutter project involved repeating the same boilerplate code over and over again. So we built a
tool to help streamline that process.

The first version started as a simple script to reduce this repetition. But as projects grew,
maintaining and updating those scripts became another form of boilerplate. That’s when we decided to
turn it into a package-based tool — so you only need to update it once, and it works across your
codebase.

As we expanded, Butterfly began handling common patterns like authorization logic. Initially, all
logic (core and auth) lived in the same package, but we realized not every app needs authentication
— so we split it out to keep things flexible.

Butterfly is now a lightweight ecosystem to help you start building beautiful, maintainable apps
faster. Earlier versions locked developers into using specific libraries
(like a default local database), but we've learned from that. The current Butterfly gives you more
freedom to choose the tech you prefer.


<Info>In the early days, only the CLI tool was called "Butterfly CLI." But now, the entire ecosystem
shares the name: **Butterfly**.</Info>

#### Why the name "Butterfly"?

The name **Butterfly** was inspired by its natural beauty and its connection to Flutter. Just like a
butterfly flutters gracefully, we want your Flutter app to be elegant and smooth. The word
“Butterfly” also shares a similar sound with “Flutter,” making it feel right at home. And since
butterflies are often associated with beauty and transformation, we hope Butterfly helps your
codebase evolve into something just as beautiful.


### Removable Library?

Butterfly is **not** a framework — it's a lightweight tool designed with removability in mind.
We understand that developers are often cautious about adopting new tools, especially those that
might be discontinued in the future. That’s why we built Butterfly to be easy to remove from your
codebase at any time, without hassle.

Our documentation clearly shows how to implement each feature using **Flutter's native approach**,
without relying on Butterfly. Most of our helper guides come with two tabs: one showing how to do it
with Butterfly, and the other showing how to do it manually. This ensures you're never locked in —
you can adopt Butterfly with confidence and remove it whenever you need.

### Project Structure Philosophy

Butterfly doesn’t follow the typical **Clean Architecture** approach. Instead, it uses a simpler,
more intuitive structure that feels natural for most Flutter projects — with top-level folders like
`models`, `services`, `screens`, and `widgets` sitting right at the root of your project.

We understand that Clean Architecture aims to group related files by feature to make it easier to
navigate and manage — and that totally makes sense in theory. But in practice, especially with
modern IDEs and tools, it’s no longer a must.

Thanks to features like **Ctrl+Click**, **Go to Definition**, and **Find All References**,
developers can easily jump between classes, services, and widgets without having to manually dig
through nested folders. So instead of over-complicating the project structure, Butterfly keeps
things simple and avoids unnecessary indirection.

Even large, mature frameworks like **Laravel** don’t strictly follow Clean Architecture. Open a
fresh Laravel project and you’ll see it leans more toward organizing by type (models, controllers,
services) than by feature.

We believe this structure:

- Keeps your codebase clean and easy to follow
- Avoids premature optimization
- Feels more natural for everyday development
- Prevents the headache of deciding where to place shared services or utilities

At the end of the day, it’s not about following trends — it’s about making your development
experience smoother and your codebase more maintainable.

However, if you prefer the Clean Architecture style, you might consider using the
[Stacked](https://pub.dev/packages/stacked) package. Stacked is a Flutter framework designed for
building production applications with testable, scalable, and maintainable code. It provides a
complete frontend architecture and includes a CLI to generate views, services, and more, adhering to
the Clean Architecture principles. You can learn more about Stacked in their
[official documentation](https://stacked.filledstacks.com/docs/getting-started/overview/).
