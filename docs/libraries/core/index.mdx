## Introduction

The Core Library provides foundational tools and helpers designed to maintain a beautiful and
well-structured Flutter codebase. It operates independently from user-specific logic, making it safe
to use even without the Auth Library.

One of the central pieces in this library is the `CoreService` class. Originally called
`FrameworkService`, it was renamed to avoid naming collisions with Flutter's internal APIs.

In Butterfly, services that should be extended in your project are typically prefixed with `Base`.
In this case, the actual base class is called `BaseCoreService`. When you run `butterfly init`, a
file named `core.dart` is generated inside the `services` folder. It defines your project-specific
`CoreService` class that extends `BaseCoreService`.

This `CoreService` acts as the bridge to features provided by the Core Library, including:

- Global error handling
- Theme switching support
- Full-screen loading UI

> **Can you skip using `CoreService`?**
> Technically yes — but you'd miss out on those features. We strongly recommend keeping it in place.
